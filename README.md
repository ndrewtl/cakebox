# Cakebox
A DIY build system for javascript et. al

# Why?
Grunt and Gulp are great build systems, but sometimes depend on plugins that aren't frequently updated.
Sometimes building a project with Webpack feels like cocking a bazooka at an ant.

This project is designed to obviate plugins by putting configuration entirely in the developer's hands.
Bring your own modules and build your project how you'd like.
